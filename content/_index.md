## Welcome :earth_africa:
I am Johannes Nauta, and I am a postdoctoral researcher that pursues my current interests in complex systems.
I am currently a member of [...]
Early 2021 I finished my Ph.D. thesis on computational models of optimal foraging patterns.
During my Ph.D. I studied effects of intra- and interspecific species interactions and focused on how the specific form of the interaction graph influences (group-) optimal behavior.
I additionally studied the influence of the spatial distribution of resources on the foraging efficiency.
The latter research is in line with my current interests in ecosystem stability.
I intend to continue an interdisciplinary approach to complex systems, with specific focus on long-term stability of ecosystems.


For more information on my research interests, please see [`~/research`](research).
