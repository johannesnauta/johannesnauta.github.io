## Welcome :earth_africa:
My name is Johannes Nauta, and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher studying networks and complex systems at the Dept. of Physics of the University of Padova in Italy.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

### Current research
My work aims to unravel how local (microscopic) feedback mechanisms influence global (meso- and macroscopic) dynamics of (meta)populations. 
More specifically, I am developing general multi-scale models that define ecological reaction-diffusion systems on networks. 
These models show that long-term stability can emerge from local interactions, both between competing species (reaction) and between the nodes (diffusion).

### My trajectory
After obtaining my bachelor and master degrees in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, I moved to Ghent, Belgium to do my Ph.D.
Early 2022, I finished my Ph.D. thesis on computational models of optimal foraging patterns.
I studied the effects of intra- and interspecific interactions of foragers and focused on how the characteristics of the interaction graph influences (group-) optimal foraging behavior.
I additionally studied the influence of the spatial distribution of resources on the short-term foraging efficiency and the long-term population dynamics.
The latter research is in line with my current interests in ecosystem stability and function.
I am currently pursuing an interdisciplinary approach on the edges of ecology, microbiology, and statistical physics, in order to unravel the mysteries behind ecosystem function.
More specifically, I would like to understand the mechanisms that facilitate long-term stability of ecosystems with many constituents.
