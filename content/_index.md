## Welcome :earth_africa:
I am Johannes Nauta, and I am a postdoctoral researcher studying complex systems.
I am currently a member of the Dept. of Physics of the University of Padua, Italy.

Early 2022 I finished my Ph.D. thesis on computational models of optimal foraging patterns.
During my Ph.D. I studied the effects of intra- and interspecific interactions of foragers and focused on how the characteristics of the interaction graph influences (group-) optimal froaging behavior.
I additionally studied the influence of the spatial distribution of resources on the foraging efficiency population dynamics.
The latter research is in line with my current interests in ecosystem function.
I intend to pursue an interdisciplinary approach to complex (eco)systems with specific focus on the long-term stability of ecosystems.


For more information on my research interests, please see [`~/research`](research).

#### Current position _(as of January 1st, 2023)_
Postdoctoral researcher, Dept. of Physics, University of Padua, Italy. \
Member of the [CoMuNe Lab](https://twitter.com/comunelab) research group, lead by [Manlio De Domenico](https://manliodedomenico.com/).

  </br>⤷ <small>A. Vitali and colleagues study how an invasive species can disrupt a multilayer network that contains a specific keystone interaction. They show that the invasive species reduces the connectivity between the species present in the keystone interaction and thereby increases disturbance propagation and reducing network robustness.</small>
