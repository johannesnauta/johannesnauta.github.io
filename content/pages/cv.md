    "<em>Dispersal and network topology strongly influence meta-ecosystem stability</em>".
    <br>â¤· <small>Oral presentation on linear stability of meta-ecosystems using random matrix theory. Our results show that patch network topology and dispersal mediate linear stability. More specifically, we show that disconnected patch networks need to be sufficiently large and sufficiently connected for the global system to remain stable.</small>
