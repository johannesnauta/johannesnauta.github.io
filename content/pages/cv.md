    "<em>Dispersal and network topology strongly influence meta-ecosystem stability</em>".
    <br>⤷ <small>Oral presentation on linear stability of meta-ecosystems using random matrix theory. Our results show that patch network topology and dispersal mediate linear stability drastically. More specifically, we show that dispersal can provide stability when dispersal rates are sufficiently large, patches are sufficiently diverse, and the dispersal network topology is sufficiently random.</small>

    "<em>Dispersal and network topology strongly influence meta-ecosystem stability</em>".
    <br>⤷ <small>Oral presentation on linear stability of meta-ecosystems using random matrix theory. Our results show that patch network topology and dispersal mediate linear stability. More specifically, we show that disconnected patch networks need to be sufficiently large and sufficiently connected for the global system to remain stable.</small>

    "<em>Predicting maintenance of mobile genetic elements in large microbial systems</em>".
    <br>⤷ <small>Poster presentation on predicting the maintenance of mobile genetic elements in random microbial systems. The randomness pertains to the assumed random nature of interactions. Using methods from epidemiology, we were able to accurately predict whether mobile genetic elements were maintained --- in epidemiological terms, they become endemic --- and showed that maintenance depends strongly on interactions.</small>
